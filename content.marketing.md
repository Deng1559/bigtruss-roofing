## üîß **Service-Focused Content**

### **Roof Cleaning - The Big Truss Difference**
```markdown
Your Burnaby home faces unique challenges - from the coastal moisture that feeds aggressive moss growth to the debris from our beautiful mature trees. Our specialized roof cleaning process doesn't just remove what you can see; we eliminate the root systems that cause long-term damage.

**What Makes Us Different:**
- Eco-friendly solutions safe for your family, pets, and the Burnaby ecosystem
- Hand-removal of moss and debris (no harsh pressure washing that damages shingles)
- Zinc strip installation to prevent future moss growth for 2-3 years
- Before/after photos delivered within 24 hours of completion
```

### **Gutter Cleaning - Beyond the Basics**
```markdown
Burnaby's tree-lined streets are beautiful - until those leaves end up in your gutters. Our comprehensive gutter service protects your foundation, basement, and landscaping from water damage that costs thousands to repair.

**Complete Gutter Care:**
- Full debris removal and disposal (we bag and remove everything)
- Downspout inspection and snake-cleaning for proper water flow
- Minor repair service for loose brackets and small leaks
- Gutter guard consultation to reduce future maintenance
```

### **Pressure Washing - Restoration Specialists**
```markdown
From your driveway to your deck, Burnaby's wet climate creates the perfect breeding ground for algae, mold, and mildew. We don't just blast dirt away - we restore surfaces to their original condition safely and effectively.

**Surface Expertise:**
- Driveway and walkway restoration (removes oil stains and tire marks)
- Deck and fence cleaning (wood-safe techniques that won't cause damage)
- Siding cleaning (safe for vinyl, wood, and composite materials)
- Patio and outdoor space preparation for entertaining season
```

#### **Email 2: Education Focus**
```markdown
Subject: "What that green stuff is really doing to your roof üè†"

[Name], see that green on your Burnaby neighbor's roof?

That's not just moss - it's a $15,000 problem in disguise.

Here's what most homeowners don't know: Moss doesn't just sit on your shingles. It actively lifts them, creating gaps where water penetrates. Every rain drives moisture deeper into your roof structure.

The result? Rotted decking, damaged insulation, and eventually... a complete roof replacement.

Don't let this happen to your home. Get your free assessment: (778) 858-6355
```
